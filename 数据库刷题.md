# 简单的 #
## Combine Two Tables ##
- Table: Person

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```
- Table: Address

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```
- Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:`FirstName, LastName, City, State`
- 代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select p.FirstName,p.LastName,m.City,m.State from Person p LEFT JOIN Address m on p.PersonId=m.PersonId;
```

## Second Highest Salary ##
- Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
- For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
- 思路：我们可以使用Max函数来做，这个返回最大值，逻辑是我们取出的不包含最大值的数字中的最大值，即为第二大值：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee where Salary not in (select max(Salary) from Employee)
```
## Employees Earning More Than Their Managers ##
- The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```
- Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```
- 代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e.Name as Employee from Employee e where e.Salary>(select m.Salary from Employee m where m.Id =e.ManagerId )
```
## Duplicate Emails ##
- Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

```
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```
- For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```
- 思路：首先对Email计数，然后选择出计数大于等于2的，代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select m.Email from (select Email, count(Email) as Count from Person group by Email) m where m.Count>=2;
```

```
select Email from Person group by Email having count(Email)>=2;
```
## Customers Who Never Order ##
- Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.
- Table: Customers.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```
- Table: Orders.

```
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```
- Using the above tables as example, return the following:

```
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```
- 代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Name as Customers from Customers where Customers.Id not in (select CustomerId from Orders)
```

## Delete Duplicate Emails ##
- Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
```
- For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```
- Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.
- 思路：建立内交让两个表以邮箱关联起来，然后把相同邮箱且Id大的删除掉，参见代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
delete p2 from Person p1, Person p2 where p1.Email=p2.Email and p1.Id<p2.Id;
```

## Rising Temperature ##
- Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

```
+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
```
- For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

```
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+
```
- 思路：建立两个内交表，比较温度，然后日期加一天筛选，日期用TO_DAYS()函数转换到天，代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select w1.Id from Weather w1 inner join Weather w2 
where TO_DAYS(w1.RecordDate) = TO_DAYS(w2.RecordDate) + 1 and w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;
```
## Big Countries ##
- There is a table World

```
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| name            | continent  | area       | population   | gdp           |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
| Afghanistan     | Asia       | 652230     | 25500100     | 20343000      |
| Albania         | Europe     | 28748      | 2831741      | 12960000      |
| Algeria         | Africa     | 2381741    | 37100000     | 188681000     |
| Andorra         | Europe     | 468        | 78115        | 3712000       |
| Angola          | Africa     | 1246700    | 20609294     | 100990000     |
+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
```
- A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million.
- Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.
- For example, according to the above table, we should output:

```
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| name         | population  | area         |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan  | 25500100    | 652230       |
| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
```
- 代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name,population,area from World where area>3000000 or population>25000000
```

## Classes More Than 5 Students ##
- There is a table courses with columns: student and class
- Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.
- For example, the table:

```
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
```
- Should output:

```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```
- 需要查询一个数量count，于是做分组查询后，发现有的数据没有过滤掉，于是就想加上过滤条件，就在group by后边写了where ，发现不好使，直接就报错了，查了一下，where只能写在group by前边，要想在后边加限制条件，应该使用having关键字,代码：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select c.class from courses c group by class HAVING count(distinct c.student )>4
```

## Not Boring Movies ##
- X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the movies’ ratings and descriptions.
- Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.
- For example, table cinema:

```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```
- For the example above, the output should be:

```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```
- 代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id,movie,description,rating from cinema where id%2=1 and description != 'boring' order by rating desc;
```
## Swap Salary ##
- Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temp table.
- Note that you must write a single update statement, DO NOT write any select statement for this problem.
- Example:

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
```
- After running your update statement, the above salary table should have the following rows:

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```
- 代码：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
update salary set sex=IF(sex='f','m', 'f')
```
# 中等 #
## Nth Highest Salary ##
- Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
- For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```
- mysql的函数我还不会，但函数里面的语句是正常的，选择第几大元素，就先把这个元素排序，然后用limit 1 加上偏置 offset N-1.代码如下：

```
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  SET N = N - 1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select Salary from Employee group by Salary order by Salary desc limit 1 offset N
  );
END
```
## Rank Scores ##
- Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```
- For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```
- 代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Score,(select count(distinct Score) from Scores where Score>=s.Score) as Rank from Scores s order by Score desc;
```
## Consecutive Numbers ##
- Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

```
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
```
- For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```
- 思路：一开始是想计数，然后选择大于3的，但是count会对整个进行计数，然后查看网上，建立三个内联表，连续并且分数一样就打印，代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct l1.Num as ConsecutiveNums from Logs l1 join Logs l2 on l1.Id=l2.Id-1 join Logs l3 on l1.Id=l3.Id-2 where l1.Num=l2.Num and l3.Num=l2.Num
```
## Department Highest Salary ##
- The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```
- The Department table holds all departments of the company.

```
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```
- Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

```
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```
- Explanation:Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.
- 思路：这道题让给了我们两张表，Employee表和Department表，让我们找系里面薪水最高的人的，实际上这题是Second Highest Salary和Combine Two Tables的结合题，我们既需要联合两表，又要找到最高薪水，那么我们首先让两个表内交起来，然后将结果表需要的列都标明，然后就是要找最高的薪水，我们用Max关键字来实现，参见代码如下：

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
#select Id, Salary from Employee group by Id having Salary=(select max(Salary) from Employee)
select d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary from Employee e join Department d on e.DepartmentId=d.Id where Salary in (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId)
```
## Exchange Seats ##
- Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.
- The column id is continuous increment.
- Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
- Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```
- For the sample input, the output is:

```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```
- Note:If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
- 思路：对照上表及其查询结果可以得知，当原id为奇数时，交换座位后的id变为id+1,当原id为偶数时，交换座位后的id变为id-1,另一个方面需要考虑的是，学生人数为奇数时，最后一个学生的id不变，故应当用子查询确定学生的人数，然后分情况讨论即可。

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select (case 
        when id%2 !=0 and id!=Count then id+1 
        when id%2 !=0 and id=Count then id 
        else id-1 end) as id, student 
        from seat,(select count(*) as Count from seat) as s order by id asc;

```
